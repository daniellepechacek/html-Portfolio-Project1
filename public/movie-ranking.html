<h1>Favorite movies</h1>
<h2>These are movie recomenndations.</h2>
<h3>1. The Breakfast Club</h3>
<p>I love 80's teen movies and this one is a classic.</p>
<h3>2. The Roaring Twenties</h3>
<p>I went through a phase where I was into James Cagney. This movie had a lot of really good quotes.</p>
<h3>3. Twister</h3>
<p>Whenever this was on TV I would watch it. Never got sick of it. Not sure why. Looking forward to the new movie, but of course the original will always be the classic.</p>
<h3>4. Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>Good emotional drama.</p>
<h3>5. Life is Beautiful</h3>
<p>This one is a -watch one time- one because of the subject matter, but it's very good and the scene where the dad is "translating" the camp rules is pretty funny.</p>
